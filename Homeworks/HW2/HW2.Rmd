## HW2 - Simple Data Mining
This homework is to meant for you to do some basic data mining tasks using statistics from your prior classes.

Context - US's winner takes all voting system
Most of the voting in the US takes the form of "winner-takes-all" which encourages the formation of a two party system. We will see if we can identify the party affiliations simply by looking at the voting patterns.

We've collected data from the [senate.gov](https://senate.gov)

Q1 Data wrangling of the Senate Voting
In votes.json, you will find the Senate voting records from the 105th to 115th Senate. The file is organized by senators, each with an id encoded by S followed by a digit. For each senator, their voting record for the last version of the bill is recorded, 1 stands for "Yea", -1 stands for "Nay", 0 stands for "Not voting", and -9999 is used if there were issues during data collection. The bills are labeled with the congress term (e.g. 106), the session number (e.g. 1 or 2), then the issue ID.

Please wrangle this dataset into a matrix called voting_matrix so we can calculate the correlation between the senators' voting behavior, i.e. we will run cor(voting_matrix, ...) in Q3 to identify how senators' vote with one another.

Please report the dimensions of your matrix and what percentage of the matrix does not contain -1, 1, or 0. For example, if I only have 2 senators and 2 bills where one out of the four terms is not -1, 1, or 0, then I would report 25%.

I'm intentionally not telling you what are the columns and what are the rows, this should be implied.
Q2 Expectations
Please articulate your expectations for the correlation matrix given the 2 party system.

What's its dimension?
How many modes do you expect to see in the distribution of correlation values?
Where will the correlation values center?
Q3 Mining with correlations
Please calculate the correlation value between the senators' voting pattern, please set use=pairwise.complete.obs in the function cor().

Please explain why R will warn you that some correlations cannot be computed.
Please plot the histogram of the lower triangular values within the correlation matrix. Hint: lower.tri
Please comment on this histogram relative to your expectations from Q2. Side comment: make sure this makes sense to you!
Please re-order the correlataion matrix such that it starts with the highest positive correlation (1) to the strongest negative correlation (-1) with respect to Senator McConnell's votes, i.e. the previous Senate majority leader who has served since 1985 (id=S174, member of the Republican Party). Note that the majority leader is the party's spokesperson for the party's position on issues.
It would make sense to filter out senators who do not overlap Senator McConnell.
Please try to visualize this re-ordered correlation matrix, hint: image()
Please list the senators, if any, who have a negative correlation with Senator McConnell's votes but an average greater than 0.2 correlation with the "possible Republicans".
We will define a 'possible Republican' as someone with a correlation of 0.2 or higher voting record with Senator McConnell.
You will need the file voters.json to get the names of these senators.
Why might this group be interesting if they exist? This will not be graded by the grader but your projects will require you to make this kind of articulation. This should be done in 5 or fewer sentences.
Q4 Machine learning intuition with regression
We will compare 2 feature selection methods for regression, with the goal of predicting a senator's voting pattern. In both methods, for any target senator, we will select 2 other senators to predict their vote on any issue.

Method 1:
Pick the senators with the strongest positive and strongest negative correlation with the chosen senator.
Run OLS against both senators simultaneously.
Method 2:
To identify the first senator, simply find the one senator with the strongest correlation.
Run OLS of the target senator against the first senator and obtain the residuals.
Identify the second senator by identifying the senator whose voting record has the strongest correlation with the residuals from above.
Re-run OLS against both senator simultaneously.
Please answer the following:

Why isn't choosing the 2 senators with the 2 strongest positive correlations a reasonable strategy? This should be 3 or fewer sentences.
What does lm() do when one senator has no voting record for a particular bill? Is the behavior different if the senator is the independent or dependent variable?
For each senator, please randomly choose 20% of their bills data into a test set, then use the remaining 80% of bills to run both methods above. Please report which method has a better prediction performance according to what you see?
Do not impute the missing values
You should choose a prediction metric
This is not a full cross validation because we are not rotating the test set.
Please visualize the prediction performance across senators for both methods.
Side comment: For data mining purposes, one might look into the existence of a popular predictive senator!
